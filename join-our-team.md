<p>Dear Real Estate Sales Professional,</p>

<p>Are you a hard working, solution seeking, persistent, positive, sales person who brings their best every day and wants to work around other hard working A+ players?</p>

<p>Our fast growing company offers unlimited income potential and growth opportunities with less risk to driven individuals.</p>

<p><strong>Most real estate agents are not bringing in enough money to pay the bills, have inconsistent income, and are not sure where their next paycheck is coming from.</strong>  In fact, the average income of a real estate agent is $47,700 a year and in 2014 NAR reported 87% of all new agents fail after five years in the industry and only 13% make it.</p>

<p>You can try to spend money on buying leads or paying for things you hope will work, attend trainings without accountability, or work with a company that does not offer high income potential.</p>

<p>Rather than worrying about lack of money, having no prospects in the pipeline, inconsistency, going broke or quitting the business, we can show you a system that has helped dozens of agents reach six figures in annual income consistently.</p>

<p><strong>We offer direct mentorships with top producing agents in the top 1% of the industry, training on high level sales and real estate solutions, free quality leads, and one on one coaching. We guarantee to help you make $100k your first year in real estate and consistent and reliable income from there on.</strong> </p>

<p>The benefits of working with us is that you can <strong>earn while you learn, work in a positive work environment, be a part of an award winning team, and have access to all the tools and skills needed to be successful.</strong> </p>

<p>For example, John Barton came to us as a beverage sales executive who never earned more than $60K a year in the beer business and <strong>within his first year</strong> as an agent was able to generate close to <strong>$100k in commission.</strong> Jennifer was an <strong>experienced agent and made more money with more freedom in our system.</strong>  Lizzie started with us as a part time runner and <strong>sold her first house within the first 45 days of being a full time licensed agent.</strong></p>

<p>We offer a <strong>base plus bonus</strong> to start for entry level sales positions, <strong>50/50 split</strong> for buyer agents, and up to <strong>80% split for experienced agents</strong> with the opportunity to earn more:
<ul>
<li>Unparalleled training</li>
<li>A constant source of leads and clients</li>
<li>Solid reputation in the community</li>
<li>Two brokers available at all times for advice</li>
<li>Your own personal website</li>
<li>FREE business cards</li>
<li>Phone time</li>
<li>FREE Office space</li>
<li>FREE E&O insurance</li>
</ul></p>

<p>After completing the information form you will be scheduled to speak with Kristy directly and invited personally to attend our Local Expert Realty Business Planning Session. Upon attendance you will be invited to a one on one session to outline your goals. Once all of those steps are complete and we ensure you are a good fit, you will then be enrolled in our Fast Track Training. <strong>We guarantee if you follow all the training and use the tools provided, you will make $100K in your first year as a full time real estate agent or we will pay you the difference!</strong></p>

<p>We are only accepting 3 applicants at this time and we already have leads and clients for you to work RIGHT NOW. <strong>Start earning commissions immediately.</strong></p>
